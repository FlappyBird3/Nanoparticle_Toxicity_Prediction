# Nanoparticle Toxicity Predictor
This machine learning project classifies nanoparticle toxicity (Toxic/nonToxic) using a Kaggle dataset. It analyzes 11 physical-chemical features, including coresize, surface charge, and dosage for NPs like ZnO and CuO. The workflow features EDA and the training of Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Bagging Classifiers optimized for F1-score.
